Engaged in a project focused on advancing heat transfer modelling in rectangular slabs, incorporating variable material properties, internal heat generation, and realistic boundary conditions. Employed the Finite Difference Method to adeptly analyse and visualise heat transfer dynamics alongside Grid Independence verification for enhanced accuracy and reliability.
